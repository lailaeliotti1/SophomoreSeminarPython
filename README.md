Sophomore Seminar

**Intro to project**

For my research topic, I explored Python! I researched the history,
differences from object oriented languages, how to do algorithms
for job interviews, and basic syntax differences from Java. I chose this as my
research project due to this being named the best language to use for software
engineer interviews. My project shows the growth of my knowledge of Python and new data
structures to tackle difficult algorithms.

**Final Research Topic**

Now, I am going to use the feedback given back by Prof Zhang to focus on divide and conquer algorithms, such as binary search in Python. In divide and conquer approach, the problem in hand, is divided into smaller sub-problems and then each problem is solved independently. When we keep on dividing the subproblems into even smaller sub-problems, we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible. Those smallest possible sub-problem (fractions) are solved. The solution of all sub-problems is finally merged in order to obtain the solution of an original problem. Breaking up the problem helps the computer with time and space. In binary search we take a sorted list of elements and start looking for an element at the middle of the list. If the search value matches with the middle value in the list we complete the search. Otherwise we eleminate half of the list of elements by choosing whether to procees with the right or left half of the list depending on the value of the item searched.
This is possible as the list is sorted and it is much quicker than linear search.Here we divide the given list and conquer by choosing the proper half of the list. We repeat this approcah till we find the element or conclude about it's absence in the list.

**Progress**

For the past couple of weeks, I have diving into different algorithms using
Python. By definition, an algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed
in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
Something that can be repeated and proven. For instance, I have studied the
reverse integer algorithm that casts a int to a string to compute. I have also
studied the two sum algorithm that finds all the pairs of two integers in an un-
sorted array that sum up to a given S. I have focused on the delete
node with given key algorithm. Given the head of a linked list and a key, you
must delete the node that contains this given key. I have studied
the fill the blanks algorithm that takes in a list of integers and then returns the
list with missing consecutive numbers included. Finally, how binary search and merge sort algorithms work with time and complexity.
